# Note: Your backend API (server.js) needs to be deployed separately
# Options:
# 1. Deploy backend to Heroku/Railway/Render and proxy API calls
# 2. Use Netlify Functions to convert your Express routes
# 3. Deploy backend separately and update API_URL in app.js

# Example: If you deploy backend to Heroku, uncomment and update:
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/api/*"
#   to = "https://your-backend.herokuapp.com/api/:splat"
#   status = 200
#   force = true
